        <h1>Gotta go fast: The most expensive car in the world that’s for sale</h1>
        <p>While the current stimulus check certainly won’t be enough to cover this one-of-a-kind toy, that shouldn’t stop you from saving to fulfill your dream of owning the most expensive car in the world. After all, we all have objects of desire that
            are mostly unrealistic. So come on, let’s dream together!</p>
        <p> It appears that the Bugatti La Voiture Noire is currently the most expensive car in the world, priced at a jaw-dropping $18.7 million with a top speed of 261mph, capable of going from 0-60mph in just 2.5 seconds. Are you kidding? Imagine how much
            more it could go for in auction someday.
        </p>
        <p>The Bugatti La Voiture Noire, which simply translates from French to “the black car”, is perhaps the epitome of guilty-pleasure spending, as this car is owned by only the richest of the rich, including soccer phenom Cristiano Ronaldo, who bought
            the car as a gift to himself in 2020. </p>
